Cyclistic bikeshare data has been cleaned and aggregated using SQL and analysis visualized using Tableau. 

# Introduction
In the following case study, I will perform the real-world tasks of a junior data analyst for a fictitious bike-sharing company. To answer the business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## Background
Cyclistic is a bike-share company founded in 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. The company has more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations in the Chicago metropolitan area. Besides traditional bicycles and e-bikes, Cyclistic offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes to make bike-sharing more inclusive to people with disabilities. The pricing plans offered are single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.

# Ask
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have determined that annual memberships are more profitable than single-ride and day-passes. Cyclistic marketing director Lily Moreno believes converting casual riders into annual members is the best way to ensure the company’s growth. 

The goal of Moreno’s marketing team is to design strategies to convert casual users into annual members by determining 1) how casual users and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, 2) why casual riders would buy Cyclistic annual memberships, and 3) How Cyclistic can use digital media to influence casual riders to become members.

# Task
Moreno has assigned me the task of answering 1) How casual users and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
